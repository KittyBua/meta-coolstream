This is my first try at creating a BSP layer for the
Coolstream HD1 Set-Top-Box models (HD1, neo, neoÂ², zee)

It is not yet finished and some hacks in it need improvement.

Anyway, have a lot of fun...

It s nothing in here that reinvents the wheel. It is mostly a collection of dirty hacks to get things working somehow. Just to be correctly and to express, that forking and improving this layers is very welcome: 

All changes that i have made to this layer are published under the BSD-2-Clause License. You should find a copy of the license in your yocto/poky/meta/files/common-licenses folder
